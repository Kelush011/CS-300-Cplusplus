1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

    In this course we were learning how to read data in a file and insert it into different data structures. For our project we were to take this knowledge we learned and implement it into a design for an application that will be used to list out all of the computer science classes in order alphabetically and also print a sample schedule. It should also allow the user to search for a specific class and figure out what prerequisites are required for that specific class. We were also to take that design and turn it into an actual program that runs and does all of the things required.
   
3. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

   For this project I decided to use a Binary Search Tree. I decided that was the best option for this assignment and I rolled with it. I think its extremely important to understand how data structures work because most programs require a way to store information received from a file and allow the user to interact wih it. Understanding how these data structures work can help me to understand how most technology works as well. This project was definitely eye opening into the complexity of programs and how they work.
    
5. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

   This course was definitely an eye opening experience for me. It made me realize just how advanced programming can be and just how difficult it can be. I definitely encountered a lot of roadblocks during this course and I will admit it was not always my best work on these activities. I realized just how much more I need to practice in order to get to the level I want to be at. It was challenging for me and the complexity of these data structures had me very perplexed at times but I just continued to try my best throughout the duration of this course.
   
7. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

   This project has expanded my view on coding. It has allowed me to look at my approach in a new light. It has inspired me to practice more and better myself in the art of developing program. It has been a challenge that has made me want to strive to be able to implement these designs without coming across any of the issues I had during this course. It also allowed me to look at programming in a new light giving it an almost 3-D feel instead of just a 2-D flat plain of program. 
   
9. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    This project has allowed me to have a better understanding of just how complex and 3 dimensional a program really is. It also has made me realize that clarity in the code is extremely important to writing a code. Its easy to design a plan for a complex design but its even harder to implement that design into a working program. It has allowed me to expand my knowledge of the programming world and this course will always remind me that there is always room for improvement and practice is extremely important in this field.
